HOODRICH was founded in 2014 by Jay Williams and embodies its brand mantra FROM NOTHING TO SOMETHING.

Started with just £200 in 2014, in Birmingham from the boot of his car selling t-shirts Jay’s mindset was by any means necessary. Then in 2019, the Hoodrich world changed when retail powerhouse Footasylum started buying into the brand and then global giant JD Sports took the brand to another level. Fast forward to today, HOODRICH is one of the fastest growing streetwear brands sold in almost 1000 retail stores globally across 23 different countries.

The brand has been endorsed by the likes of 50 Cent, K Trap, Fumez the Engineer, Russ Millions, Chipmunk, Aitch, Luh Tyler to mention just a handful as well as collaborating with Netflix back in 2022 for the launch of season 2 of Top Boy.

Iconix purchased a majority ownership in the brand in November 2023, partnering with Jay on the next stage of this phenomenal growth phase.
