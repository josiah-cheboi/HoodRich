Hoodrich Pablo Juan is officially a free man.

The Georgia rapper, born Sterling Leroy Pennix Jr., was released from a Georgia state prison on Oct. 19, where he had been serving time for violating the state’s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act. Footage shared online shows the rapper smiling and embracing supporters shortly after his release.

Back in 2022, Hoodrich Pablo Juan accepted a plea deal that resulted in a 15-year sentence, with five years to serve and the remaining time under strict probation. He was also ordered to pay a $2,000 fine.

The artist was initially among 46 alleged co-conspirators indicted in October 2020 on sweeping gang-related charges. The group collectively faced 92 RICO counts, 59 gang-terrorism violations, multiple drug-trafficking charges, and several counts of aggravated assault, kidnapping, and murder.

According to prosecutors, Juan was accused of being affiliated with the Rollin’ 20s Neighborhood Bloods. Under the terms of his probation, he is prohibited from associating with any gang members or possessing weapons.

While incarcerated, Juan continued to voice support for fellow rapper Young Thug, who remains entangled in his own YSL RICO case. In a 2023 message from prison, he said:

“We do this sht for the hood, we from the hood, we still in the hood. Y’all know what the f** going on. Free Slime, man. Keep all the rats, free all the real n*s. Y’all know what the f going on man, we never letting up.” No further details about his release have been shared.
